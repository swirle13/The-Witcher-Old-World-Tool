# The-Witcher-Old-World-Tool

Online tool to help ease the small tedia of the board game The Witcher: Old World

The main goal is to create a few tools to make the randomized parts of the game more fluid and faster than the current methods, something akin to the automations in Tabletop Simulator.

*The Witcher: Old World Helper* is available [here](https://swirle13.github.io/The-Witcher-Old-World-Tool/).

A few ideas:

* Lost Mount location randomizer (can be just a d20, but there are 19 locations, 0-18). Unsure how it integrates with Skellige expansion.
* 3 Monster panel with results button(s) adjacent which automatically randomize same level monster or increased monster level and randomizes location to same type
* Quest location randomizer
  * Terrain tokens
* Monster Trail
  * Location randomizer
  * Terrain tokens
  * Weakness tokens
  * Destruction tokens (movement?)
* (Much more complex/longer term) Monster passive/ability calculator to help resolve any questions on how a passive would trigger/resolve/etc provided a current player's card combo
* Witcher/mage card randomizer.
  * Rule book says shuffle and pick two, yet the backs of each player card has the school icon on the back, making it not truly random.
  * can choose which expansion(s)
* All location randomizers will try to take already-used locations into account, when/where applicable. Until implemented, users can just reroll and there will be a notice when a location shouldn't be on the same space as another entity.
* Inventory list for each expansion
  * Cards
